# house-price-pred

This project predicts house prices using a **Random Forest Regressor** trained on housing data with features like location, size, and property attributes. It includes data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, model training, and evaluation using metrics such as R², MAE, and RMSE. Built with **Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib,** and **Seaborn**, the model delivers strong predictive accuracy and can be extended for further optimization or web app integration.
